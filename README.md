// This was the first attemption to my programming carreier, I was at 42 Schools while I was taking prep classes, so I really tried to understand the dynamics of C programming 
because we accomplished some projects about Shell script, so C programming language has some new and mysterious type of blocks, when I finished the Final Exam I was very exausted 
because of the length of the exam which is about six hours. That was a pressious memory from my collage life - time.
