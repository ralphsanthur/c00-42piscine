This was my first attempt at programming. I was at 42 Schools while taking prep classes, so I really tried to understand the dynamics of C programming.
We worked on some projects related to shell scripting, so the C programming language had some new and mysterious structures for me.
When I finished the final exam, I was very exhausted because of its length, which was about six hours. That was a precious memory from my college years.
